    <h3>Scrolling Effect</h3>

    <p>Ramadan[a] (Arabic: رَمَضَان, romanized: Ramaḍān [ra.ma.dˤaːn];[b] also spelled Ramazan, Ramzan, Ramadhan, or Ramathan) is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar,[8] observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting (sawm), prayer (salah), reflection, and community.[9] A commemoration of Muhammad's first revelation,[10] the annual observance of Ramadan is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam[11] and lasts twenty-nine to thirty days, from one sighting of the crescent moon to the next.[12][13]

        Fasting from dawn to sunset is obligatory (fard) for all adult Muslims who are not acutely or chronically ill, travelling, elderly, breastfeeding, diabetic, pregnant, or menstruating.[14] The predawn meal is referred to as suhur, and the nightly feast that breaks the fast is called iftar.[15][16] Although rulings (fatawa) have been issued declaring that Muslims who live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca,[17] it is common practice to follow the timetable of the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day.[18][19][20]
        
        The spiritual rewards (thawab) of fasting are believed to be multiplied during Ramadan.[21] Accordingly, during the hours of fasting, Muslims refrain not only from food and drink, but also tobacco products, sexual relations, and sinful behavior,[22][23] devoting themselves instead to prayer and study of the Quran.[24][25]
        
        Etymology
        The word Ramadan derives from the Arabic root R-M-Ḍ (ر-م-ض) "scorching heat",[26] which is the Classical Arabic verb "ramiḍa (رَمِضَ)" meaning "become intensely hot – become burning; become scorching; be blazing; be glowing".
        
        Ramadan is thought of as one of the names of God in Islam by some, and as such it is reported in many hadiths that it is prohibited to say only "Ramadan" in reference to the calendar month and that it is necessary to say "month of Ramadan", as reported in Sunni,[27][28][29][30][31][32] Shia[33][34][35][36][37][38] and Zaydi[39] sources. However, the report has been graded by others as Mawḍūʻ (fabricated)[40] and inauthentic.[27]
        
        In the Persian language, the Arabic letter ض (Ḍād) is pronounced as /z/. The Muslim communities in some countries with historical Persian influence, such as Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, India, Pakistan and Turkey, use the word Ramazan or Ramzan. The word Romzan is used in Bangladesh.
        Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. But whoever is ill or on a journey, then ˹let them fast˺ an equal number of days ˹after Ramaḍân˺. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful.

        — Surah Al-Baqara 2:185
        Muslims hold that all scripture was revealed during Ramadan, the scrolls of Abraham, Torah, Psalms, Gospel, and Quran having been handed down on the first, sixth, twelfth, thirteenth (in some sources, eighteenth)[41] and twenty-fourth Ramadans,[year needed] respectively.[42][self-published source] Muhammed is said to have received his first quranic revelation on Laylat al-Qadr, one of five odd-numbered nights that fall during the last ten days of Ramadan.[43]
        
        Although Muslims were first commanded to fast in the second year of Hijra (624 CE),[42] they believe that the practice of fasting is not in fact an innovation of monotheism[44] but rather has always been necessary for believers to attain taqwa (the fear of God).[45][Quran 2:183] They point to the fact that the pre-Islamic pagans of Mecca fasted on the tenth day of Muharram to expiate sin and avoid drought.[46][self-published source] Philip Jenkins argues that the observance of Ramadan fasting grew out of "the strict Lenten discipline of the Syrian Churches," a postulation corroborated by other scholars, including theologian Paul-Gordon Chandler,[47][48] but disputed by some Muslim academics.[49]
        
        Important dates
        The first and last dates of Ramadan are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar.[3]
        
        Beginning
        
        Ramadan beginning dates between Gregorian years 1938 and 2038; including an error on the ante-penultimate line. This table is based on an unspecified variant of the Islamic calendar and that, according to local practices, there can be differences of one (or even two) days.
        Because the Hilāl, or crescent moon, typically occurs approximately one day after the new moon, Muslims can usually estimate the beginning of Ramadan;[50] however, many[who?] prefer to confirm the opening of Ramadan by direct visual observation of the crescent.[51]
        
        Laylat al-Qadr
        Main article: Night of Power
        The Laylat al-Qadr (Arabic: لیلة القدر) or "Night of Power" is the night that Muslims believe the Quran was first sent down to the world, and Muhammad received his first quranic revelation from it. The night is considered to be the holiest night of the year.[52][53] It is generally believed to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan; the Dawoodi Bohra believe that Laylat al-Qadr was the twenty-third night of Ramadan.[54][55]</p>
